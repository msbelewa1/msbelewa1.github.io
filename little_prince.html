    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
    <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u> 
    <mark>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark> 
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, 
    and I said to myself: <span class="red"><b>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</b></span>
  </p>

  <p>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
    <span class="red-bold">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, 
    is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being 
    like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> 
    And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
    <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished 
    by a little puff of wind...</u>
